CyberFly MicroPython No-Code IoT Device

This is a no-code solution that automatically:
1. Enters BLE provisioning mode on first boot or button press
2. Allows configuration of WiFi, device credentials, AND sensors via mobile app
3. Auto-detects available sensors and suggests configurations
4. Automatically starts the IoT device with configured sensors
5. Handles sensor commands from the IoT platform

No programming required - everything is configured via BLE!
