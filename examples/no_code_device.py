=== BLE Provisioning Protocol ===

The enhanced BLE provisioning now supports a multi-step setup process:

1. DEVICE CONFIGURATION (first step):
   Send device config JSON:
   {
     "device_id": "my-iot-device",
     "ssid": "MyWiFi", 
     "wifi_password": "password123",
     "network_id": "testnet04",
     "publicKey": "...",
     "secretKey": "..."
   }
   
   Response: {"status": "sensor_ready", "available_sensors": [...], "detected_sensors": [...]}

2. SENSOR CONFIGURATION (second step):
   Send sensor config JSON:
   {
     "config_type": "sensors",
     "sensors": [
       {
         "sensor_id": "temp1",
         "sensor_type": "temp_internal", 
         "enabled": true,
         "alias": "CPU Temperature"
       },
       {
         "sensor_id": "led1",
         "sensor_type": "digital_out",
         "inputs": {"pin_no": 2},
         "enabled": true, 
         "alias": "Status LED"
       }
     ]
   }
   
   Response: {"status": "sensor_saved"} -> Device restarts

3. DEVICE OPERATION:
   After restart, device automatically:
   - Connects to WiFi
   - Loads sensor configurations  
   - Starts IoT platform connection
   - Begins handling sensor commands
   
=== Available Sensor Types ===

The system auto-detects and suggests these sensors:

â€¢ temp_internal - Internal temperature sensor (always available)
â€¢ system_info - Memory/uptime monitor (always available)  
â€¢ digital_in - Buttons, switches (requires pin_no)
â€¢ digital_out - LEDs, relays (requires pin_no)
â€¢ analog_in - Potentiometers, light sensors (requires pin_no)

Auto-detected sensors include:
â€¢ Boot button (GPIO 0)
â€¢ Status LED (GPIO 2 on ESP32, GPIO 25 on RP2040)

=== IoT Platform Commands ===

Once configured, the device automatically handles these commands:

// Read all sensors
{"sensor_command": {"action": "read"}}

// Read specific sensor  
{"sensor_command": {"action": "read", "sensor_id": "temp1"}}

// Control output device
{
  "sensor_command": {
    "action": "execute",
    "sensor_id": "led1",
    "params": {"execute_action": "toggle"}
  }
}

// Get sensor status
{"sensor_command": {"action": "status"}}
